FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters are a commonly used filtering method in the field of digital signal processing. FIR filters consist of a series of coefficients applied to the input signal, and these coefficients are obtained using a specific calculation method.

The name FIR filters comes from the fact that the filter response lasts for a finite period of time (a "pulse response" duration). The key characteristic of FIR filters is their ability to perform filtering by considering past and future data. This means that only the current and past input values are used to calculate the output at each point.

The frequency response characteristics of FIR filters depend on the arrangement of coefficients and how these coefficients are calculated. Typically, FIR filters are designed to define specific frequency regions such as a transition band, a stopband, and a passband. These filters allow desired frequency components of the input signal to pass while suppressing unwanted components.

The advantages of FIR filters include linear phase response, high filtering accuracy, wide bandwidth, optional design of transition and stopband regions, stability, and ease of implementation. For these reasons, FIR filters are widely used in applications such as audio processing, image processing, communication systems, and many other digital signal processing applications.
